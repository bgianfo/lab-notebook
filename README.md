# @bgianfo's Lab Notebook

This repo holds my personal lab notebook.
See: https://lab.bjg.io/background.html for more context.

It's built using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/),
to setup your own, I took some notes about the process here: https://lab.bjg.io/notes/2020-12-29.html 

Setup:
```
$ cargo install mdbook
$ cargo install mdbook-admonish
$ cargo install mdbook-mermaid
$ cargo install mdbook-toc
```

Serve and view the pages locally:
