# Compiling SerenityOS Kernel with -ftrivial-auto-var-init

## Introduction

In recent years the industry has collectively decided that it's probably time
we do something to address the various bugs that can occur from uninitialized
stack memory.

In 2018 [JF Bastien contributed "Automatic variable initialization" to LLVM][0]
and later presented that work in 2019 with his ["Mitigating Undefined Behavior"][1]
talk at the LLVM Developers Meeting.

At CppCon 2019 [Joe Bialek and Shayne Hiet-Block presented their
["Killing Uninitialized Memory: Protecting the OS Without Destroying Performance‚Äù][2]
talk which describes the `initAll` mechanism that was [built into the MSVC compiler][3]
and integrated into the windows build system to combat uninitialized stack memory bugs.
