# Compiling SerenityOS Kernel with -ftrivial-auto-var-init

## Introduction

In recent years the industry has collectively decided that it's probably time
we do something to address the various bugs that can occur from uninitialized
stack memory. A few examples of bug classes that can originate from uninitialized
stack memory include:

- Kernel information disclosure, where uninitialized struct members or
  struct padding is copied back to usermode, leaking kernel information such
  as stack or heap addresses, or secret data like stack cookies.

- Control flow based on uninitialized memory can cause a variety of issues at
  at runtime, including stack corruptions like buffer overflows, heap corruptions
  due to deleting stray pointers. Even basic logic bugs can result from control
  flow operating on uninitialized data.

__TODO: Add more history from the "Automatic initialization of variables section https://isopenbsdsecu.re/mitigations/missing_features/__

In 2018 [JF Bastien contributed "Automatic variable initialization" to LLVM][0]
and later presented that work in 2019 with his ["Mitigating Undefined Behavior"][1]
talk at the LLVM Developers Meeting.

At CppCon 2019 [Joe Bialek and Shayne Hiet-Block presented their
"Killing Uninitialized Memory: Protecting the OS Without Destroying Performance‚Äù][2]
talk which describes the `/initAll` mechanism that was [built into the MSVC compiler][3]
and integrated into the windows build system to combat uninitialized stack memory bugs
throughout the windows kernel and hyper visor stack.

SerenityOS attempts to employ a variety of [security mitigations][9] to harden
the system against would be attackers. I was interested in pursuing some sort
of stack zeroing mechanism to mitigate this entire bug class in the SerenityOS
kernel. SerenityOS utilizes GCC (version 11.2 at the time of writing) as it's
primary toolchain, with secondary support for Clang+LLVM available as well. 

So I started researching what options were available for GCC.

## Forward porting...

With a little bit of effort I was able to backport the GCC `-ftrivial-auto-var-init`
feature and the subsequent related fixes to the SerenityOS GCC 11.2 toolchain.

First we needed the [original commit][5] which contains the majority of the implementation.

    Toolchain: Backport -ftrivial-auto-var-init to our GCC 11.2 toolchain

    This change back ports the patch to support -ftrivial-auto-var-init so
    that it compiles on top of the 11.2 release. It was originally committed
    to target the GCC 12 release cycle. The back porting was just fixing up
    patch collisions, no major surgery was needed.
```

When trying to compile Serenity with a newly built toolchain with just the first patch
applied I immediately ran into an ICE (Internal Compiler Error). I put the project on hold
for a few days and decided to see if the issue had been reported upstream already. Much to
my surprise it had, and there was already a [fix available in the GCC development branch][6].

    Toolchain: Backport '__builtin_clear_padding' fix to gcc 11.2

    This change backports a fix for a bug which previously would cause us
    to ICE when compiling the Kernel, with this patch we continue chugging
    along.
```

</details>

While investigating I also [found a few][7] other [ICE fixes][8] that it looked like we should
really have if we were going to ever merge this to master, so I took care of porting those as well.

    This is a follow up fix to the main `-ftrivial-auto-var-init` patch
    that we need as well. This patch didn't require any work to apply.

After finding all the fixes I needed to backport in order to get the system to
actually build without crashing the compiler, I was eager to try it out.
The following patch is all that was needed to integrate the new compiler flag
into the SerenityOS Kernel build system.

## Investigation

After booting the system and seeing it crash, I attached a debugger to QEMU and saw
that we now have a Undefined Behavior Sanitizer crash on startup while detecting 
which processor features are available.
