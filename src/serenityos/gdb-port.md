# Porting GDB to SerenityOS

## Introduction

While working on SerenityOS over the past few years, one of things I've missed
the most is a powerful debugger. For whatever reason [Andreas][kling] and most of the
other developers working on the system don't seem to be fans using a debuggers.
Now that I think about it, Andreas even has a video titled
["Why I don't use a debugger"][kling-no-debuggie] on his YouTube channel. üòÅ

[Itamar Shenhar][itamar-twitter] has been doing a bunch of work on Hack Studio,
and as part of that has implemented `ptrace(..)` and a basic debugger known as `sdb` (See [PR #1885][sdb-pr-initial]):

```
courage:~ $ sdb /bin/ls
Program is stopped at: 0x0bfae99d (Loader.so:ELF::DynamicLinker::linker_main() +0x5ed)
Source location: ./Userland/Libraries/LibELF/DynamicLinker.cpp:585

(sdb) help
Options:
cont - Continue execution
si - step to the next instruction
sl - step to the next source line
line - show the position of the current instruction in the source code
regs - Print registers
dis [number of instructions] - Print disassembly
bp <address/symbol/file:line> - Insert a breakpoint
bt - show backtrace for current thread
x <address> - examine dword in memory

(sdb) dis 1
    0x0bfae99d <+0>:
```

The debugger integration with `Hack Studio` and the standalone `sdb` debugger are great first passes at some
basic debugging infrastructure. During my time at Microsoft I have learned to love the debugger for root
causing complicated systems level bugs and even learning how a complex program works, there's no better tool in my
humble opinion. I think I would be a lot more productive working on Serenity if I had a more powerful debugger,
like `gdb`. So I decided to port the `GNU Project Debugger` to SerenityOS!

## Initial GDB Bring Up

The initial work to get the debugger to compile went fairly smoothly. The work started in 
[PR #11278 - LibC+Ports: Add initial GDB 11.1 port][gdb-pr-initial]
