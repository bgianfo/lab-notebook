## Introduction

While working on SerenityOS over the past few years, one of the things I've missed
the most is a powerful debugger. For whatever reason [Andreas][kling] and most of the
other developers working on the system don't seem to be fans of using a debugger.
Now that I think about it, Andreas even has a video titled
["Why I don't use a debugger"][kling-no-debuggie] on his YouTube channel. üòÅ

[Itamar Shenhar][itamar-twitter] has been doing a bunch of work on Hack Studio,
and as part of that has implemented `ptrace(..)` and a basic debugger known as `sdb` (See [PR #1885][sdb-pr-initial]):

```
courage:~ $ sdb /bin/ls
Program is stopped at: 0x0bfae99d (Loader.so:ELF::DynamicLinker::linker_main() +0x5ed)

(sdb) help
Options:
cont - Continue execution
si - step to the next instruction
sl - step to the next source line
line - show the position of the current instruction in the source code
regs - Print registers
dis [number of instructions] - Print disassembly
bp <address/symbol/file:line> - Insert a breakpoint
bt - show backtrace for current thread
x <address> - examine dword in memory

(sdb) dis 1
    0x0bfae99d <+0>:
```

The debugger integration with `Hack Studio` and the standalone `sdb` debugger are great first passes at some
basic debugging infrastructure. During my time at Microsoft, I have learned to love the debugger for root
causing complicated systems level bugs and even learning how a complex program works, there's no better tool in my
opinion. I think I would be a lot more productive working on Serenity if I had a more powerful debugger,
like `gdb`.  That's when I decided to try porting the **GNU Project Debugger** to SerenityOS!

## Getting Things Compiling

The initial work to get the debugger to compile went smoothly. The work started in 
[PR #11278 - LibC+Ports: Add initial GDB 11.1 port][gdb-pr-initial].

#### The Port Script

The first task at hand was to create a script to automate the building of the port.
Serenity has it's own [ports system][ports] for describing how assets should be downloaded
and then subsequently unpackaged, and built. The initial version I arrive on looked
something like this:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env -S bash ../.port_include.sh
port=gdb
version=11.1
useconfigure=true
configopts=("--target=${SERENITY_ARCH}-pc-serenity" "--with-sysroot=/" "--with-build-sysroot=${SERENITY_INSTALL_ROOT}" "--with-newlib" "--enable-languages=c,c++" "--disable-lto" "--disable-nls" "--enable-shared" "--enable-default-pie" "--enable-host-shared" "--enable-threads=posix")
files="https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-${version}.tar.xz gdb-${version}.tar.xz cccfcc407b20d343fb320d4a9a2110776dd3165118ffd41f4b1b162340333f94"
makeopts+=("all")
installopts=("DESTDIR=${SERENITY_INSTALL_ROOT}")
depends=("gmp" "binutils")
auth_type="sha256"

# We only have a stub of getrusage(..)
export ac_cv_func_getrusage=no

# We don't support the madvise options that are used.
export ac_cv_func_madvise=no
```

We can see this does a few things:
- Specifies what version of the gdb source to download and a sha256 hash to validate that `.tar.xz` package with.
- Specifies that the port expects us to run the `configure` script.
- Specifies the configure options, which are mostly about how to target serenity's headers and libs, and what options to enable or disable.
- Expresses a dependency on the `gmp` and `binutils` ports.


#### Missing Dependencies

The next step was to modify the gdb `configure` scripts to enlighten them about the platform triplets (`i386-pc-serenity`, `x86_64-pc-serenity`), 

```diff

```

With the triplets in place I was able to actually build some code. I quickly
found some pieces we were missing. One of them was `sigtimedwait()`, I [mentioned
it in the project's discord][discord-sigtimedwait] and it just so happened that
[Idan Horowitz][idanho] had recently worked on the signal handling subsystem in the Kernel offered to help me out.

```
bgianf ‚Äî 12/11/2021
If anyone is interested in some kernel work,
I need sigtimedwait() for a port of GDB.
I'll get around to it if no one is interested...
but just thought I'd throw it out there in case someone is collecting yaks 

IdanHo ‚Äî 12/11/2021
I just touched signal handling a bunch, so I'll try looking into it
```

I continued to work in parallel, but the next morning I woke up to a nice little
gift, Idan had sent out [Kernel+LibC: Signals galore][signals-galore] which included
support for `sigtimedwait()`!

The next issues I encountered  were the `pthread_sigmask` and the pthread signal APIs
that gdb can use. SerenityOS didn't implement these APIs at the time, but it was easy
enough to disable them to make progress as gdb appeared to have fallback mechanisms when
they were disabled. This ended up being a patch to the `configure` script:

```diff

The last thing holding us back from successfully compiling + linking gdb was that SerenityOS didn't implement `tcsendbreak(..)`
or `tcdrain(..)`. Fortunately, we didn't have to worry about supporting real terminals, a no-op [stub implementation
was sufficient for our purposes][libc-stubs].

After putting all of these changes together, I had a basic gdb build successfully
compiling.

#### GDB Enlightenment

## Testing

Now that we had some basic code setup and a basic understanding of gdb's code
is put together it was time to start trying to see what was left to get something
really working.
Much to my surprise, we could see real signs of life after including our basic serenity support.

<img style="display: block;
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;

As you can see, the program doesn't seem to actually run, it just halts.

## Bonus Bug: Kernel Process Name after `PT_TRACE_ME`

After the initial port was compiling, I started to debug what in our implementation was
causing gdb to hang. If you looked at the processes under `System Monitor` you can see that we have
two processes named `gdb`, one sitting `Stopped`, and one sitting `Selecting` which is serenity's way
of indicating a process is waiting for something.

<img style="display: block; 
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;
           width: 80%;"
src="gdb-incorrect-name.png"/>

This doesn't make any sense, why is gdb launching two processes, and why is it hanging waiting for itself?
One thing I was wondering is why was the `ptrace(..)` call failing with not permitted? I quickly hacked up some logging to the ptrace
implementation in the Kernel to let me see what was happening.

249.278 [#0 gdb(51:51)]: signal: SIGCONT resuming gdb(51:51)
```

The logging output gives us a clue, we appear to be properly forking and calling
ptrace correctly, however the name of the process appears to be incorrect in the
kernel? 

After some digging around in the code, the issue turned out to be the location
where we were updating the process name in `execve(..)` had a very minor bug
which caused the process name to be incorrect. The fix was trivial, it can be
found here: [Kernel: Set new process name in do_exec before waiting for the tracer](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/12464).

The commit message itself provides a nice description of the interaction between
`fork()`, `ptrace()` and `execve(..)` that are involved here:

Subject: [PATCH] Kernel: Set new process name in `do_exec` before waiting for
 the tracer

While investigating why gdb is failing when it calls `PT_CONTINUE`
against Serenity I noticed that the names of the programs in the
System Monitor didn't make sense. They were seemingly stale.

After inspecting the kernel code, it became apparent that the sequence
occurs as follows:

    1. Debugger calls `fork()`
    2. The forked child calls `PT_TRACE_ME`
    3. The `PT_TRACE_ME` instructs the forked process to block in the
       kernel waiting for a signal from the tracer on the next call
       to `execve(..)`.
    4. Debugger waits for forked child to spawn and stop, and then it
       calls `PT_ATTACH` followed by `PT_CONTINUE` on the child.
    5. Currently the `PT_CONTINUE` fails because of some other yet to
       be found bug.
    6. The process name is set immediately AFTER we are woken up by
       the `PT_CONTINUE` which never happens in the case I'm debugging.

This chain of events leaves the process suspended, with the name  of
the original (forked) process instead of the name we inherit from
the `execve(..)` call.

To avoid such confusion in the future, we set the new name before we
block waiting for the tracer.

After this fix, we can see that PID 40 calls `PT_TRACE_ME`, which suspended
