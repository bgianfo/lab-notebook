# Writing CodeQL Queries for SerenityOS

I previously added CodeQL static analysis support to the SerenityOS build workflow.
[https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/4175](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/4175)

Unfortunately you there doesn't seem to be a way to consume the CodeQL database that as part of that
build pipline on GitHub.
This seems like a bit of an oversight, and I have raised an issue here: [https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues/355](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues/355)

To work around that we will need to create our own database so we can write some custom CodeQL queries.

**Here are the steps I put together:**

 1) Setup a clone of the VSCode Starter Workspace ([docs](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/setting-up-codeql-in-visual-studio-code/#using-the-starter-workspace))
     ```bash
     $ git clone https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql-starter.git
     $ cd vscode-codeql-starter
     $ git submodule update --init --remote
     ```

 2) Build a codeql database for serenity OS ([docs](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/creating-codeql-databases/)):

    ```bash
    $ codeql database create -l cpp -s /home/bgianf/src/serenity -c "make -j -C /home/bgianf/src/serenity/BuildMake" ~/serenity-codeql
    ```

 3) Install the VS Code CodeQL extension ([docs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-codeql))

 4) Configure the VS Code CodeQL extension to point to your new database (`~/serenityy-codeql`)

 5) Open the `vscode-codeql-starter` workspace in VS Code.

 6) Open the `cpp/example.ql` query and start writing queries and executing them against the database.

    This simple example finds all classes in the `AK` standard library in SerenityOS:
    ```python
    import cpp

    from Class c
    where c.getQualifiedName().matches("AK::%")
    select base.getQualifiedName()

    ```
