# 12-29-2020: Setting Up A Lab Notebook

## Initial Idea

I've noticed a few people whom I follow and admire online have started to keep lab notebooks.
I first ran across the idea when I saw [whitequark](https://twitter.com/whitequark)'s notebook [lab.whitequark.org](https://lab.whitequark.org/),
and then tis evening I ran across [bitshiftmask](https://twitter.com/bitshiftmask)'s [lab.jamesmunns.com](https://lab.jamesmunns.com/) by chance
and saw they were doing a similar thing with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) which seems very easy and straight forward.

I've been on a personal knowledge management kick recently, and I've been playing wiht [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for maintaining a 'second brain'.
The idea of a public lab notebook seems like an interesting idea that I want to play with. So this first post is going to be the process of setting this up.

## Boot Strapping

To get started with the notebook first I created a new github repo [github.com/bgianfo/lab-notebook)(https://github.com/bgianfo/lab-notebook).
Then I configured my lab notebook `mdbook` project just enough so that this page building.

```bash
C:\src\lab-notebook>tree /A /F
|   .gitignore
|   book.toml
|   README.md
|
\---src
    |   SUMMARY.md
    |
    \---notes
            2020-12-29.md
```

Once we have the shell of the project setup and can use `mdbook serve` to have the system automatically rebuild and refresh pages as we edit them:
```bash
C:\src\lab-notebook>mdbook serve
2020-12-29 03:02:15 [INFO] (mdbook::book): Book building has started
2020-12-29 03:02:15 [INFO] (mdbook::book): Running the html backend

2020-12-29 03:02:22 [INFO] (mdbook::book): Running the html backend
```

## Publishing

Now that we have the basics of the book building, I want to get the notebook
published, and served off of my subdomain [lab.bjg.io](https://lab.bjg.io) where
nothing currently resides today. To make this pain free as possible I was hoping
to use github pages for this, the same as the rest of my site. When poking around
I found the [mdbook-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mdbook-action)
which allows you to painlessly publish your mdbook from a github actions workflow.
