# 12-29-2020: Setting Up A Lab Notebook

## Introduction

I've noticed a few people whom I follow and admire online have started to keep lab notebooks.
I first ran across the idea when I saw [whitequark](https://twitter.com/whitequark)'s notebook [lab.whitequark.org](https://lab.whitequark.org/),
and then this evening I ran across [bitshiftmask](https://twitter.com/bitshiftmask)'s [lab.jamesmunns.com](https://lab.jamesmunns.com/) by chance
and saw they were doing a similar thing with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) which seems very easy and straight forward.

I've been on a personal knowledge management kick recently, and I've been playing whit [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for maintaining a 'second brain'.
The idea of a public lab notebook seems like an interesting idea that I want to play with. So this first post is going to be the process of setting this up.

## Boot Strapping The Book

To get started with the notebook first I created a new GitHub repository [github.com/bgianfo/lab-notebook)(https://github.com/bgianfo/lab-notebook).
Then I configured my lab notebook `mdbook` project just enough so that this page building.

```bash
C:\src\lab-notebook>tree /A /F
|   .gitignore
|   book.toml
|   README.md
|
\---src
    |   SUMMARY.md
    |
    \---notes
            2020-12-29.md
```

Once we have the shell of the project setup and can use `mdbook serve` to have the system automatically rebuild and refresh pages as we edit them:
```bash
C:\src\lab-notebook>mdbook serve
2020-12-29 03:02:15 [INFO] (mdbook::book): Book building has started
2020-12-29 03:02:15 [INFO] (mdbook::book): Running the html backend

2020-12-29 03:02:22 [INFO] (mdbook::book): Running the html backend
```

## Publishing

Now that we have the basics of the book building, I want to get the notebook
published, and served off of my subdomain [lab.bjg.io](https://lab.bjg.io) where
nothing currently resides today. To make this as pain free as possible I was hoping
to use **github pages** for this, the same as the rest of my site. When poking around
I found the [mdbook-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mdbook-action)
which allows you to painlessly publish your mdbook from a github actions workflow.

Following the documentation I was able to create a [simple workflow (324781fae)](https://github.com/bgianfo/lab-notebook/commit/324781fae79572ea954d9bb5f8bd103b5c808e1b#diff-28802fbf11c83a2eee09623fb192785e7ca92a3f40602a517c011b947a1822d3):

```yaml
name: Publish To GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup mdBook
        uses: peaceiris/actions-mdbook@v1
        with:
          mdbook-version: 'latest'

      - run: mdbook build

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./book
```

I looked for signs that the action ran, and nothing... so double checking the pipeline
I realized that github created the new default branch as `main`, not `master`.
(See announcement here: https://github.com/github/renaming)

So we nee one small change to our pipeline to fix things up:

```diff

That worked and automatically created a new `gh-pages` branch in the repository.
In the GitHub repository settings I was then able to configure **github pages**
to use the new gh-pages branch. See: [GitHub Docs: Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)


I then configured github pages to publish under a custom domain (lab.bjg.io), this
will automatically create a new [CNAME](https://github.com/bgianfo/lab-notebook/commit/5a85fb76a5d87e720913c3ae8d92be26387abf1d)
file in the root of your project. Next I  went to by DNS provider and added a new 
**CNAME** record to my domain configuration pointing `lab.bjg.io -> bgianfo.github.io`.

And Voila! It Alive!

Well kind of ... As soon as I pushed new changes, the sub domain no longer works.
That is very strange?

After some digging in the CI logs, I realized that the `actions-gh-pages` action was
deleting the CNAME file in the gh-pages branch on every push, breaking the configuration.
I looked through the docs for the gh-pages action and found they have their own
option for auto generating the CNAME file from within the action. So I made a
small change to use that option:
