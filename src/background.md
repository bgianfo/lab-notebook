# Introduction

Welcome to my lab notebook, where I keep my public working notes, or
tips and tricks that I discover. If you want to get in
touch with me check out [bjg.io/about](https://bjg.io/about/).

The idea for this "lab notebook" was inspired by:
- [@whitequark](https://twitter.com/whitequark) - [lab.whitequark.org](https://lab.whitequark.org/)
- [@bitshiftmask](https://twitter.com/bitshiftmask) - [lab.jamesmunns.com](https://lab.jamesmunns.com/) 

It's built with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and automatically
published with [mdbook-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mdbook-action).
You can read more about how I setup the notebook in the [2020-12-19 - Lab Notebook Setup](./notes/2020-12-29.md)
note. The source is available at [bgianfo/lab-notebook](https://github.com/bgianfo/lab-notebook).
